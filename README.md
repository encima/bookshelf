# Bookshelf

## What?

A simple way to manage bookmarks across browsers and platforms, with only the requirement for `rust` and `sqlite`.

## How?

Clone this repo and run `cargo build`

## Current State?

This is under active development and partly a side project as well as way to learn rust. I imagine it will change extensively as I work on it.

## TODO

In no order.

* [] Separate out DB connections
* [] Tests folder
* [] Catch connection errors and handle them
* [] Create tables one time and do not run again
* [] Export bookmarks to .html files
* [] Implement tagging and sections

## Can I Help?

Yes. Pull request the hell out of this. Any guidance on what I have done thus far. Rust based quirks or best practices I may be missing etc.
